    <h4>People's Perspective of Others</h4>
    <p> Do you have somebody in mind that you can't keep your mind off of them and they
    kind of know you, but don't at the sametime? Continue reading this site if yes.
    If no, then have fun not having this feeling.</p>
    <p> If you have them in any of your classes, then you should...
    -Ask them to help with a prblem you are "stuck" in
    -recommend the teacher to assign seats with them and you seating next to each other
    While doing that, drift off on that topic and talk about things that you know she or he likes. 
    This will start yuor bond with them strong. If you don't, then try to find extracurricular activities
     they are in. However, if you can't handle their personality, 
    then you should give up on them because you won't be happy if you keep this up.</p>
